# Wine Quality Prediction
This is a project I and my teammate (@shayna-gaulden) did in our Regression Analysis class. We wanted to create a regression model to predict the wine quality of red variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine, so below we

* Visualized the data to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns.
* Checked the assumptions of Linnear Regression models.
* Built multiple regression models to predict the wine quality.
* Presented and wrote a report communicating results to non-technical and technical audiences.
